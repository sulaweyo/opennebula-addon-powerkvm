# PowerKVM Hypervisor support for OpenNebula

## Description

This addon provides a driver to add the IBM PowerKVM hypervizor to OpenNebula.
PowerKVM basically provides the same functionality as kvm but for the PPC platform. It could reuse the KVM driver actions but we want to cleanly distinguish between the two types to make sure kvm vm does not accidently end on a powerkvm node or vice versa.
